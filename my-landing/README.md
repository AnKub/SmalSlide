🌀 Swipify™ — Because Your Images Deserve a Catwalk
Welcome to Swipify™, the fancy-pants, no-backend-needed, totally-not-overengineered™ JavaScript slider for your web page. We don’t just slide images — we elevate them.

🚀 Features:
Synchronized triple-slider madness: image, background, and title — all swiping together like besties...

Smooth open & close animations so slick, even your grandma’s old photo albums will want in.

Scroll-based text animation because... well, why not?

Responsive design. On desktop? Great. On mobile? Still looks fab.

No backend, no fuss, all the drama.

🧙‍♂️ How it works:
Drop it in, slap your images inside .slide__picture, and Swipify will do its magic ✨.

📦 Install
You don’t. Just copy-paste like it’s 2009.
